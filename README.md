# :wrench: ComfyUI Essentials

Essential nodes that are weirdly missing from ComfyUI core. With few exceptions they are new features and not commodities. I hope this will be just a temporary repository until the nodes get included into ComfyUI.

## Node list

- Get Image Size
- Image Resize (adds "keep proportions" to scale image)
- Image Crop (includes auto crop to all sides and center)
- Image Flip
- Image Desaturate
- Image Posterize
- Image Contrast Adaptive Sharpening ([credits](https://github.com/Jamy-L/Pytorch-Contrast-Adaptive-Sharpening))
- Mask Blur
- Mask Flip
- Mask Grow / Shrink (same as Mask grow but adds shrink)
- Mask Preview
- Simple Math
- Console Debug (outputs any input to console)

- TODO: Mask Save
- TODO: documentation

Let me know if anything's missing
